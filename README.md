Multi-Objective Optimization of Effectiveness vs Cost of a Heat Exchanger

Repo containing code for multi-objective optimization of a heat exchanger.
Effectiveness and cost cannot both be optimized without a trade-off, our goal is to find a suitable pareto frontier of optimal solutions to solve this problem.

The folders included here contain the code for the algorithms used in our project.
